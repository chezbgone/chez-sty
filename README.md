# chez-sty

These are the .sty files that I use to compile all of my documents.

* **chezbase.sty** contains the macros and basic packages that are used in both beamer presentations and documents. There are no options for this package, and you typically should not load this directly.
* **chez.sty** contains the setup for document-type LaTeX files. Note that I use KOMA-script, so there will be errors in non-KOMA-script document classes. For reference, the KOMA-script classes are `scrbook`, `scrreprt`, and `scrartcl`. The main features of this file include general formatting and theorem boxes.
   * `nodate` removes the date from the title generated by `\\maketitle` and accounts for the extra space.
   * `serif` reverts the section headers to a serif font, like the default LaTeX style.
   * `nofancy` removes the headers.
   * `nocolor` changes formatting to use grayscale instead of color.
   * `nobox` styles theorems traditionally, as opposed to with boxes.
   * `code` enables code boxes for displaying code. Note that you need to compile with option `-shell-escape` when this is enabled.
* **chezb.sty** contains the configuration for beamer presentations. This is currently unfinished.

To use, include the line `\usepackage{chez}` (and similar for beamer) with the desired options in the header of the document.
